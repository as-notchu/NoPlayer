Music Player (Avalonia desktop app)

What this app is
- A cross-platform desktop music player built with Avalonia UI.

What it can do
- Load audio files from a chosen folder.
- Display a playlist/track list and allow selection.
- Play, pause, seek, skip next/previous.
- Shuffle and repeat playback.
- Adjust volume and show playback progress/time.

Tech stack
- C#/.NET
- Avalonia UI (XAML + MVVM)
- BASS audio library (via platform-specific runtime setup scripts)

How it works
- App entry point wires Avalonia application and loads the MainWindow.
- MainWindowViewModel exposes commands (play/pause/next/previous, etc.) and state.
- The UI (MainWindow.axaml) binds to the view model for playback controls, track list, and sliders.
- Services handle audio playback and media key integration.

Additional info
- Platform-specific build/publish scripts exist for macOS and Windows.
- Assets and styling are defined in Avalonia XAML styles within Views.
